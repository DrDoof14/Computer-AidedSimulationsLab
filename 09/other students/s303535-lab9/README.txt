To start the simulation it is needed only to run main.py.
To make it easier, I've attached already all output plots.
--in delays_plots/ there are plots with the end of the transient detected
--in batch_means_ci_plots/ there are the ones correlated with the output of batch_means
--avg_vs_u_no_t.png is the plot showing the average delay in function of the utilization
