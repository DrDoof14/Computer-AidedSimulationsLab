- In the zip file you will find one .py file : "Lab9_s303382.py".

-Also the folder with all the graphs is in the zip file. 

- "Lab9_s303382.py" contains the definition of the simulator, the functions used by the simulator, and the main function. In the main function I just call the simulator. Note that if you want to change the input parameters of the simulation you just have to modify the values of the parameters when calling the simulator function. 

- You can run the program either using an IDE or the command line.

- Take into account that if you want to run the script you need to have all the libraries specified in the code available (i.e. installed on the machine supposed to run the code).


_____OPTIONAL_____Note about the command line approach:
If you want to run the script directly from the shell you have just to type python Lab9_s303382.py

Possibile debugging only for this last approach (executing from the shell): 

- If you are not able to run the script from the shell, make sure that you've added python.exe to the PATH (as an environment variable) and have specified the exact / absolute path of the file "Lab9_s303382.py" when calling the python interpreter.
