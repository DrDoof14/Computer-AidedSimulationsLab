In the zip file, as requested there are the main.py and the preprocessor.py.

main.py: 
It is ready to run, the parameters and settings are the ones explained in the report but you are free to modify them. If 	    				you want to change the parameters just keep in mind the constraint of MAX_M < N.
One suggestion might be to continue the extensions increasing the number of experiments for the probability distribution and the average, simply to observe further how both of them will converge at specific values. 

NOTE: "birthday.csv" has to be in the same folder of "main.py", cause the first one contains the real data of birthdays from 1969-01-01 to 1988-12-31. Main.py will load and aggregate the csv to compute the "realistic" distribution requested.

preprocessor.py: 
Read the files saved from the main.py and show the results obtained. 

NOTE: Be careful to keep the two *.py programs in the same folder, cause the main.py will save the files in its current folder. To be able to read the files of the metrics with preprocessor.py they have to be in the same folder.

Take into accounts that both files are using imported python libraries and you have to install them in your IDE/environment to be able to run the files. If you have all the required libraries (indicated in the initial part of both of the *.py) you can run the files bot from a IDE ( I'm using PyCharm ) or from a python interpreter installed on your machine.
