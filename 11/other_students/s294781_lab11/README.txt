You can run the simulation by starting the s294781_simulation.py script (e.g. python s294781_simulation.py).
It doesn't require any input parameter, it performs the analysis and shows the plots described in the report.
If you want to change some of the thresholds described in the report, they are set as constants at the beginning of s294781_simulation.py.
